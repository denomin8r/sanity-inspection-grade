[] Add Call to Action to "Sanity" poster
  - First Idea: **Want to help clean up your city? Scan this QR code!**

  Great selections! Those four are all strong for different reasons:
**"READY TO HELP? → SCAN THIS CODE"**
- Most conversational and approachable
- Question format feels less demanding
- "This code" is very specific and clear

**"JOIN THE MOVEMENT → SCAN HERE"** 
- Implies something bigger is already happening
- "Movement" suggests organized momentum
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)

**"YOUR CITY NEEDS YOU → SCAN NOW"**
- Most urgent and direct
- Strong emotional pull
- Classic motivational structure

**"JOIN THE VISUAL CLEANUP → SCAN HERE"**
- Clearest about what they're joining
- "Visual cleanup" is specific and descriptive
- Sets clear expectations

**For maximum impact, I'd rank them:**
1. **"YOUR CITY NEEDS YOU → SCAN NOW"** - Most compelling, urgent
2. **"READY TO HELP? → SCAN THIS CODE"** - Most inviting, accessible
3. **"JOIN THE MOVEMENT → SCAN HERE"** - Great momentum builder
4. **"JOIN THE VISUAL CLEANUP → SCAN HERE"** - Clearest about purpose

You could even test different ones in different neighborhoods to see which gets better response rates. The beauty is they all work well together as part of the same campaign.

Which one feels most "you" when you imagine it on those abandoned buildings?
- I will choose **"YOUR CITY NEEDS YOU → SCAN NOW"** for the first run. I can always change later.


[x]  Write the copy for "Reclamation" Poster

# Notes
- Meant to be pasted over ads
- Add an obvious subliminal message
  - "I am your brother's keeper"
  - "Welcome to our family"
- "Your attention has been reclaimed by Demonin8r" -- but I have not returned their attention to them
- Needs a Call to Action
- There needs to be both mystery as well as clarity
- I have Denomin8r.com

# Copy
- "Your attention has been reclaimed by Denomin8r"
- "WHERE ONCE THERE WAS AN AD, IS NOW ONLY A D"
- "Your brain thanks you"
- "People JUST LIKE YOU are posting these all over the city"
- "Help Yourself"
- "Help Others"
- "Keep NYC Ad-Free"
- CTA: "Join the Takeover: Scan Here"
- Bottom: "You are now Free to look again"
- Subliminal: "Welcome to our family"
- Subliminal: "I am your brother's keeper"
**This particular sequence of statements are snappy (could be sharpened!), engaging, compelling, and ultimately signal the purpose of the poster**

People seem to be responding to "Sanity"... I guess that cheeky element clues people in that it's a joke. And after all, Denomin8r is about appealing to the lowest common denominator. Yeah, people like the Sanity Inspection Grade. I'll stick with that.
